                    A factor is a piece of information used to verify a person's identity for security purposes. The three most commonly recognized factors are:
                </p>
                <ul class="newlist">
                    <li>
                        'Something you KNOW', such as a password or PIN
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        'Something you HAVE', such as a credit card or mobile phone
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        'Something you ARE', biometric data, such as fingerprint, retina
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br />
                <p>
                    In today's increased mobile users, traditional user login method of simple username and password is not secure enough anymore and poses high risk to corporate data. Two-factor authentication reduces such risk by introducing the dynamic password generated using OATH (Open Authentication) event-based and time based algorithms.
